			The match was a tense affair, with both teams showcasing exceptional fielding skills and strategic bowling. Rain threatened to disrupt the proceedings, but thankfully, the entire 20 overs were completed.<br>

This victory marks a significant moment for Indian cricket. It comes after a narrow loss in the 50-over World Cup final last year and signifies the team's dominance . Rohit Sharma, the victorious captain, praised his team's composure under pressure and hailed this win as a special achievement.<br>

South Africa, despite their valiant effort, fell short of their first World Cup title in any format. However, their performance throughout the tournament has been commendable, and they leave Barbados with their heads held high.<br>

<h2>PARIS 2024 OLYMPICS: JAVELIN WORLD CHAMPION NEERAJ CHOPRA TO LEAD 28-MEMBER INDIAN ATHLETICS TEAM - FULL SQUAD</h2>
<img src="olympicsimg.png" width="1500px" height="1000px">
<p>A 28-member Indian athletics team, led by menâ€™s javelin throw defending champion Neeraj Chopra, will compete at the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) announced on Thursday.<br>

Chopra made history three years ago by becoming the first Indian track and field athlete to win a medal at the Olympics, that too a gold. This time, the Indian javelin throw ace will have Olympic debutant Kishore Jena for company in his pet event.<br>

Annu Rani, who won the gold medal at the Asian Games last year, will compete in the womenâ€™s javelin throw event.<br><br>

The 28-member athletics squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics includes eight athletes, who were part of the Indian contingent at the Tokyo Olympics. The Paris-bound squad includes 17 men and 11 women athletes.

Besides Neeraj Chopra and Annu Rani, menâ€™s 3000m steeplechase athlete Avinash Sable, one of Asiaâ€™s top menâ€™s shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, womenâ€™s race walker Priyanka Goswami and 4x400m relay runners Muhammed Anas, Amoj Jacob and Subha Venkatesan competed in Tokyo three years ago.<br><br>

Muhammed Anas, part of the Indian menâ€™s 4x400m relay team, will be making his third straight appearance at the Summer Games.

Ace hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, shot putter Abha Khatua and steeplechaser Parul Chaudhary will make their Olympic debuts.

Parul Chaudhary, who will compete in the 3000m steeplechase and 5000m race, is the only athlete chosen to compete in two individual events. She won the gold medal in the 5000m race at the Asian Games last year to go with a silver in the 3000m steeplechase.<br><br>

National record-holder Akshdeep Singh, Vikash Singh and Paramjeet Singh Bisht will compete in the menâ€™s 20km race walk event while Suraj Panwar will feature in the mixed marathon event with Priyanka Goswami.

Akshdeep Singh, Ram Baboo, Vikash Singh, Paramjeet Singh Bisht and Suraj Panwar were all eligible for selection for the menâ€™s 20km race walk event at the Paris Olympics. Suraj made the cut through world rankings while the remaining four had breached the entry standard.

However, with each country allowed a maximum of three athletes per event and one per gender in the mixed marathon race walk event, Ram Baboo missed out.<br><br>

Priyanka Goswami, a Commonwealth Games silver medallist, will be the lone Indian in the womenâ€™s 20km race walk event at Paris.

Murali Sreeshankar had met the entry standard in the menâ€™s long jump but wonâ€™t be able to make it to the Paris-bound team due to an injury.

Fellow long jumper Jeswin Aldrin narrowly missed the cut through the initial Road to Paris rankings list released after June 30 but is certain to enter the final list, to be released by the World Athletics on July 7. He can still make the squad at AFIâ€™s discretion.
